to do this project first the backend folder was created and then the express module was installed
the i ran the npm init - y command was run (was suppose to do this before i installed express :> but it seems like i'll work out) 
then i globally installed the nodemon package


created a .env file , what it basically does is, it holds private variables.
To work with .env files had to npm install dotenv

for establishing the connection with the mongoDB database it is necessary to add a package npm install mongoose
and also a valid mongodb uri is required. If using mongoDB Atlas then the specific uri string must be copy pasted from the atlas website
If using local server mongoDB, then just use mongodb://localhost:27017/<DatabaseName> in this case MernApp1 is the database name

mongoose allows for the creation of schemas and structured models, mongodb byitself is actually schemaless
